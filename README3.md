1. Lecture Notes: Importance of Project Documentation
Project documentation is vital for outlining the goals, structure, and functionality of an application. It acts as a guide for developers, stakeholders, and contributors. The benefits include:

Clarity: Communicates project goals and ensures alignment.
Scalability: Simplifies future updates or feature expansions.
Collaboration: Provides a shared understanding for team members.
Efficiency: Speeds up onboarding for new contributors and reduces confusion.
